## ARISING QUESTIONS/OPTIONS WHILE DEVELOPPING

* in StockData, which type should we use to hold the stock quote
ie the stock price at a given point in time ? 

* what do we want from our so-called "app" ?
    - format and store data into some kind of storage
    - load data from storage to perform calculations
    - have an interface to somehow control all that and check results
