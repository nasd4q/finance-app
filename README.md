Not up to date !

## SO FAR

#### We have :

##### in portfolioWatcher/src/main/java - com.nasd4q.portfolioWatcher

* datafetch.Cac40Lister class able to return a List<Stock> given a LocalDate 
* model.Stock which modelizes a stock (action), based on the info 
provided by the website www.bnains.org
* model.BnainsMemberOfCac40 - an "entity" for the table data_from_bnains.membersOfCac40
* database.BnainsMembershipRepository - a very basic repo (currently supported : add item, select all)
* database - 3 package private classes able to perform various tasks

##### in portfolioWatcher/src/test/java - com.nasd4q.portfolioWatcher
* datafetch.Cac40ListerTest class that tests corresponding class
* database pckg - various tester class, including BnainsMembershipRepoTests which tests the repo

##### resource (main)
*sql.properties which stores a bunch of SQL (postgres) queries...

##### besides this, in financeApp/
* git-ignored "data from www-bnains-org" folder containing 1993-2016 historical daily
quotes (open high low close values) for (all of?) euronext stocks in text files
* git-ignored PostgresTestVolume - volume for our docker container running postgres DB
* scripts/pgdk.sh - a bash script for (re)launching (or stopping) a postgres docker container

##### other
* PortfolioWatcherApplication and PortfolioWatcherApplicationTests class
as generated by Spring initializr. Both of them doing nothing.

* pom.xml containing (besides Spring initializr default dependencies -
spring-boot-starter and spring-boot-starter-test) : 
    - Jsoup in order to parse the data from bnains website
    returned by www.bnains.org (in Cac40Lister)
    - org.postgresql:postgresql in order to communicate with db
    - spring-boot-starter-data-jdbc to reduce a bit boilerplate code for db

#### Questions : 
* Why use LocalDate rather than java.util.Date ? 
    -> immutability (+better)
* Why start off from a Spring initializr generated archetype ?
    -> testing already available + autowiring capabilities

#### Current Goals :
* set up a postgres database in order to store stocks, as well as stock membership 
in the cac 40 index at a given date
* populate the db with historical quotes for any stock appearing in cac 40 since 1993, 
using the data in "data from bnains" folder
